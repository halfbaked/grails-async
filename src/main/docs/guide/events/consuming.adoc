There are several ways to consume an event. The recommended way is to use the link:{api}/grails/events/annotation/Subscriber.html[Subscriber] annotation. Note that the class using this annotation needs to be a Spring bean.

For example:

[source,groovy]
.TotalService.groovy
----
import grails.events.annotation.*
...
include::{sourcedir}/grails-events-transform/src/test/groovy/grails/events/annotation/PubSubSpec.groovy[tags=subscriber]
----

In this example, every time a `sum` event occurs the subscriber will be invoked.

Once again the method name is used by default for the event id, although it can start with the word "on". In other words either a method name of `sum` or `onSum` would work for the above example. Or alternatively you can provide the event id to subscribe to:

[source,groovy]
----
@Subscriber('myEvent')
----

If you wish to subscribe to events dynamically or need more flexibility, then another option is to interact with the `EventBus` directly. For example:

[source,groovy]
.TotalService.groovy
----
import grails.events.bus.EventBusAware
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct
...
include::{sourcedir}/grails-events-transform/src/test/groovy/grails/events/ManualPubSubSpec.groovy[tags=subscriber]
----

In this example the `TotalService` calls `subscribe` and passes a closure within a method called `init`. The `init` method is annotated with the annotation `@PostConstruct` so that is called after the `EventBus` has been injected by Spring, ensuring it is only called once and the events are correctly subscribed to.
